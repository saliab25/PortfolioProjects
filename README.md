Context on Projects:

1) "Data Cleaning.sql" - Nashville's Housing Data Cleaning in SQL: In this project, I cleaned Nashville's housing data using SQL. I used SQL functions such as SELECT, TOP, CONVERT, ISNULL, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, PARSENAME, CASE, and COUNT, as well as SQL commands such as UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, and WITH.

2) "The Covid Project.sql" - COVID-19 Data Exploration in SQL: In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 Data using SQL. The queries range from basic data retrieval to more complex queries involving joins and subqueries, as well as creating temporary tables and views for later use

3) "Excel Project Dataset.xlsx" - Data Measurement and Analysis using Microsoft Excel: Analyzed and made a visualization using Microsoft Excel, utilizing the pivot table feature. The data used in the visualization was gathered from a comprehensive survey on the global bike sales market.

4) "Project - Data Professional Survey Breakdown.pbix" - Data Practitioners Visualization using Power BI: This report presents a visualization that I created with Microsoft Power BI, utilizing data gathered from a global survey that targeted both professional and amateur data practitioners. The survey consisted of data-related questions, and the report's visuals comprise a treemap, stacked bar and column charts, donut chart, gauge, and card. The Power BI platform was instrumental in creating a clear and informative data display, providing insights into key trends and patterns in the data.

5) "AB Testing.py" - A/B Testing and Behavioral Analysis of Smartphone Usage: Analyzed a dataset of 1,000 users to uncover patterns in mobile app engagement and screen time habits using Python. Conducted statistical tests and built predictive models to provide actionable insights.
  - Conducted A/B testing to evaluate differences in screen time by gender using Welch’s t-test.
  - Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between age and app usage.
  - Applied ANOVA to compare social media usage across different geographic locations.
  - Implemented a Chi-Square test to assess the relationship between gender and gaming app engagement.
  - Built an OLS regression model to predict total app usage based on demographic and behavioral factors, uncovering the significant influence of gaming app usage.
  - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Scipy, and Statsmodels for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and modeling.
  - Generated comprehensive insights to guide app development and marketing strategies.
  Key Tools: Python (Pandas, Scipy, Statsmodels), Statistical Testing, Regression Analysis

6) "Time Series Analysis.py" - Time Series Analysis of Temperature and Precipitation: This project conducts a time series analysis of precipitation and temperature trends during North Carolina’s wettest period (June to September 2024). Using climate data from multiple weather stations, the study aggregates daily precipitation and temperature values to identify patterns over time. The analysis employs visualizations such as line plots and rolling averages to smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends. Additionally, a seasonal decomposition method is applied to precipitation data, revealing its seasonal, trend, and residual components. A correlation analysis examines the relationship between precipitation and temperature, complemented by a heatmap for visualization. The results provide insights into weather variability during the region’s wettest season, helping understand rainfall trends and potential temperature dependencies.

7) "NYC Water Quality Analysis.py" - Assessing NYC Drinking Water Quality: Analyzing EPA Violations and Trends Using Python - This project analyzes New York City's drinking water quality by assessing compliance with EPA standards for key contaminants: Residual Free Chlorine, Turbidity, and Fluoride. Using Python, the dataset was cleaned by removing null values and converting numerical data types to avoid inconsistencies. The script identifies regulatory violations by comparing measured values against EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) and calculates the percentage of days with violations for each parameter. To visualize trends, line plots were generated to compare water quality fluctuations over time against EPA limits. The project provides valuable insights into potential health risks and areas for water quality improvement, making it useful for regulators, environmental scientists, and policymakers.

8) "ecom analysis.sql" - E-commerce Data Analysis Using SQL: Analyzed e-commerce transactions using SQL to calculate total sales, uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and purchase method distribution. As results, I identified top-selling product categories, most popular discounts, and cities with the highest sales.

10) "Danny's Diner SQL Case Study.sql" - Danny's Dinner: This SQL project was taken from a website titled "8-Week SQL Challenge". I analyzed customer spending and behavior using a dataset of sales, menu items, and membership details. I created tables for sales, menu, and members, then inserted sample data to simulate restaurant transactions. Through ten SQL queries, I addressed key business questions: calculating total spending per customer, tracking visit frequency, identifying first and most popular purchases, and determining the overall most purchased item (ramen, 8 times). I also examined purchases before and after membership enrollment, computed pre-membership spending, and calculated loyalty points under two scenarios—standard points (1$ = 10 points, sushi 2x multiplier) and a promotional first-week 2x points for members A and B in January. Using joins, subqueries, window functions (RANK), and conditional logic (CASE), I derived actionable insights to enhance customer engagement and optimize operations at Danny’s Diner.
