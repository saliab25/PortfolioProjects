Context on Projects:

1) "Data Cleaning.sql" - Data Cleaning in SQL: In this project, I cleaned Nashville's housing data using SQL. I used SQL functions such as SELECT, TOP, CONVERT, ISNULL, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, PARSENAME, CASE, and COUNT, as well as SQL commands such as UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, and WITH.
2) "The Covid Project.sql" - Data Exploration in SQL: In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 Data using SQL. The queries range from basic data retrieval to more complex queries involving joins and subqueries, as well as creating temporary tables and views for later use
3) "Excel Project Dataset.xlsx" - 
4) "Project - Data Professional Survey Breakdown.pbix" - Data Visualization in Power BI: This report presents a visualization that I created with Microsoft Power BI, utilizing data gathered from a global survey that targeted both professional and amateur data practitioners. The survey consisted of data-related questions, and the report's visuals comprise a treemap, stacked bar and column charts, donut chart, gauge, and card. The Power BI platform was instrumental in creating a clear and informative data display, providing insights into key trends and patterns in the data.
5) "AB Testing.py" - A/B Testing and Behavioral Analysis of Smartphone Usage: Analyzed a dataset of 1,000 users to uncover patterns in mobile app engagement and screen time habits using Python. Conducted statistical tests and built predictive models to provide actionable insights.
  - Conducted A/B testing to evaluate differences in screen time by gender using Welch’s t-test.
  - Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between age and app usage.
  - Applied ANOVA to compare social media usage across different geographic locations.
  - Implemented a Chi-Square test to assess the relationship between gender and gaming app engagement.
  - Built an OLS regression model to predict total app usage based on demographic and behavioral factors, uncovering the significant influence of gaming app usage.
  - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Scipy, and Statsmodels for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and modeling.
  - Generated comprehensive insights to guide app development and marketing strategies.
  Key Tools: Python (Pandas, Scipy, Statsmodels), Statistical Testing, Regression Analysis
6) "Time Series Analysis.py" - Time Series Analysis of Temperature and Precipitation: This project conducts a time series analysis of precipitation and temperature trends during North Carolina’s wettest period (June to September 2024). Using climate data from multiple weather stations, the study aggregates daily precipitation and temperature values to identify patterns over time. The analysis employs visualizations such as line plots and rolling averages to smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends. Additionally, a seasonal decomposition method is applied to precipitation data, revealing its seasonal, trend, and residual components. A correlation analysis examines the relationship between precipitation and temperature, complemented by a heatmap for visualization. The results provide insights into weather variability during the region’s wettest season, helping understand rainfall trends and potential temperature dependencies.
